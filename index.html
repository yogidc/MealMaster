              <p>"I recently had the pleasure of trying Indian food prepared by Chef Sagar and Datta Hodge, and it was absolutely delicious! Here is my 5-star review based on different categories: Taste: The flavors were rich and authentic. Every dish was perfectly seasoned and balanced. Definitely one of the tastiest meals I've had in a long time! Presentation: The dishes were beautifully presented, with great attention to detail. The colors and textures of each dish were visually appealing and added to the overall experience. Quantity: The portions were generous and satisfying. We were able to enjoy the meal without feeling like we needed more. Behavior: Chef Sagar and Datta Hodge were both extremely polite and welcoming. They took the time to explain each dish and answered any questions we had. Their hospitality made the experience even more enjoyable. Punctuality: They were on time and the meal was served exactly as we had agreed upon. This made it easy for us to plan our day and enjoy the me"</p>

              <p>Appreciate Sarita. She cooked good, tasteful food in a hygienic way. I wasn't sure about her as she was sort of new for MealMaster but she delivered a good job. She came later than promised but i think her calculation was right and she very well managed to get everything ready in time. She was patient, friendly and warm, cooked and served with love. There was some gap about ingredients from the app but we managed. I have to say, by not connecting us to d cook until d last hr, customer care is doing no good, instead they make the customer feel unsure and stressed about the whole thing. Better and open communication will help. Also, the sales guys are very prompt but when it comes to customer support, they want to keep it minimal with the help of bots. Only when a customer presses too hard is when a real person will care to speak. This is about food and hospitality. It can't be managed by emotionless bots. However, the customer support person who called me eventually was patient and good.</p>
